          <h2>Flexible Densification</h2>
          <p>In this short paper, we show how base-station densification
            can be a possible approach to create sustainable
            wireless networks which scale well with number of
            users. The key insight is that instead of relying on a single
            sophisticated base station expending power to reach
            far-off clients, the same job can be done more flexibly
            and with lower power via multiple smaller base stations
            with simpler hardware and transmitting at reduced signal
            levels. However, there exists a green point of densification,
            beyond which there are diminishing returns on
            power savings and the net power starts scaling up just as
            a consequence of managing more and more number of
            base stations. We show this green point of operation lying
            between micro and pico cells in existing LTE base
            stations via a case study. Further, we delineate the hardware,
            software and deployment level challenges and opportunities
            going ahead with this idea of reducing power
            consumption via base station densification.
            a result of operating these multiple base stations.
            Fundamentally, the reason why denser base-station.

          <h2>Deployment Challenges</h2>
          <p>5G and cellular networks would become 1.4% contributors
            to the carbon footprint, almost on par with 2% of
            the aviation industry, and is only on the trajectory of
            further increasing their carbon footprint. Wireless basestations
            are one of the major contributors to the operational
            carbon footprint, as a consequence of transmitting
            at high power levels to achieve the required communication
            range and throughput. In order to further
            keep up with the increasing data rates, and more users
            getting connected, typical approaches make the existing
            base stations even more sophisticated, like going to massive
            MIMO architectures, or mmWave communications,
            the earlier requiring many more antennas and electronics,
            and the latter operating at high mmWave frequencies
            where power amplifiers are difficult to design. Instead,
            much simpler hardware can be used at lesser transmit
            power requirements if the base station deployment is
            densified, with the key idea being that numerous simpler
            base stations can equivalently do the job of a single
            sophisticated base station. This dense deployment also
            ends up saving the power cost of transmitting at higher

          <p>Wireless base-stations form one of the highest contributor
            towards the operational carbon footprint of the wireless
            industry. These base-stations consume a lot of power
            to transmit signals at sufficiently high power in order to
            reach far-located clients, as well as in setting up multiple
            antenna hardware for MIMO, to handle the interference
            caused by multiple simultaneously communicating
            clients. Both these problems are unique to wireless networks,
            as with wired networks communicating over cables

          <h2>Algorithms & Compute challenges</h2>
          <p>Hence, the need of the hour is to somehow meet the
            increased bit-rate and user scalability demands in a sustainable
            manner. One insight could be to not further sophisticate
            the base-stations further, and instead use very
            simple hardware at low transmit level, but use a lot more
            of these simpler base stations to do the job of a more
            sophisticated single base station. Increasing the number
            of base stations would allow connecting more users, as
            well as improve the overall throughput metrics by dedicating
            the base station to particular users which would
            reduce contention across multiple users connected to a
            single base station. A natural question is that though individually
            each of these smaller base stations consume
            less power, wont the total power consumption summed
            across this network of smaller base stations be comparable,
            or more than the single base station? However,
            our key insight is that this densification actually comes at
            lower power costs, since the smaller base stations end up
            saving much more power due to communicating at lower
            transmit levels, than the increased power consumption as

            A network of smaller base-stations if managed well can
            improve the user experience since typically in single
            base-station network there is a lot of contention amongst
            its users. With densification, users can now multiple
            base-stations around them, and the base-stations can collaborate
            among themselves to handle the massive challenges
            of handover management, inter-user interference,
            improvement of data rates via collaborative decoding
            amongst base-stations, as well as on-demand flexible
            softwarized control over smaller base-stations depending
